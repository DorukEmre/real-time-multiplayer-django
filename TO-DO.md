  - It seems so strange to have different django's configs files for each container. "Django’s philosophy revolves around modularity and reusability. This is where the distinction between projects and applications comes into play. A project represents the entire web application — a collection of settings, configurations, and apps that work together to form a complete entity. An application, on the other hand, is a smaller, self-contained module within the project that serves a specific purpose. An application could be a user authentication system, a blog, or any other standalone functionality."
